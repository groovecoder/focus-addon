# METRICS

## Data Analysis
The collected data will primarily be used to answer the following questions.
Images are used for visualization and are not composed of actual data.

### Do people use this?

What is the overall engagement of Blok?  **This is the standard Daily Active User
(DAU) and Monthly Active User (MAU) analysis.**  This captures data from the
people who have the add-on installed, regardless of whether they are actively
interacting with it.

### Additional interesting questions

* What are the most popular broken sites?
  * How are they broken?
    * How might we fix them?
  * Is there an anti-blocker in the page?
* Which trackers are most commonly involved with breakage?
  * What tracking techniques are they using?
* How much time & bandwidth are users wasting with trackers?
* How often are users prompted about blocking and don't reply?


## Data Collection

### Server Side
There is currently no server side component to Blok.

### Client Side
Blok will use Test Pilot's Telemetry wrapper with no batching of data.  Details
of when pings are sent are below, along with examples of the `payload` portion
of a `testpilottest` telemetry ping for each scenario.

* The user clicks the button in the notification bar that the page works

In this case `breakage` and `notes` are also always empty.

```js
  {
    "originDomain": "www.redditmedia.com",
    "trackerDomains": ["ssl.google-analytics.com",
                       "z.moatads.com"],
    "breakage": "",
    "notes": "",
    "event": "submit"
  }
```

* The user submits a "breakage report" (which appears after they click the
  button that the page does not work)

```js
  {
    "originDomain": "www.redditmedia.com",
    "trackerDomains": ["ssl.google-analytics.com",
                       "z.moatads.com"],
    "breakage": "layout",  // or "images", "video", "buttons", "other"
    "notes": "",           // a free form text field from the user
    "event": "submit"
  }
```


A Redshift schema for the payload:

```lua
local schema = {
--   column name       field type   length  attributes   field name
    {"originDomain",   "VARCHAR",   255,    nil,         "Fields[payload.originDomain]"},
    {"trackerDomains", "VARCHAR",   1000,   nil,         "Fields[payload.trackerDomains]"},
    {"breakage",       "VARCHAR",   255,    nil,         "Fields[payload.breakage]"},
    {"notes",          "VARCHAR",   10000   nil,         "Fields[payload.notes]"},
    {"event",          "VARCHAR",   255,    nil,         "Fields[payload.event]"}
}
```

Valid data should be enforced on the server side:

* The `breakage` field MUST be either an empty string or one of "layout",
  "images", "video", "buttons", "other"

All Mozilla data is kept by default for 180 days and in accordance with our
privacy policies.
